## Why, and for what i need it
I have huge json and other text files and i have to look sometimes is  
something wrong with this files. For example json reader raised exceptions  
and so on. And then i have to look why. And for this case i wrote this  
small tool.  
I know i can you existing great tools like sed and awk and so on. But  
sometimes this great command line tool are a little oversized for me and  
and i like to code in C++. So why not a tiny tool like this to solve this  
task.
